# Password Reset Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines all the improvements made to the password reset functionality in the Penjualan Panjaratan application to ensure it works correctly and efficiently.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WhatsApp Integration Issues

  - Added eager loading where appropriate

### 5. Security Issues
- **Problem**: Missing rate limiting and security measures
- **Solution**:
  - Added rate limiting for all password reset endpoints:
    - Send reset code: 5 attempts per minute

    - Reset password: 3 attempts per minute
  - Added IP address and user agent logging
  - Enhanced input validation and sanitization

### 6. User Experience Issues

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Fonnte WhatsApp API Configuration
FONNTE_TOKEN=your_fonnte_token_here
FONNTE_URL=https://api.fonnte.com/send

# Database Configuration
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite

# Cache Configuration
CACHE_STORE=database

# Session Configuration
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
```

### Database Migration
Run the following migration to add the required table and index:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
php artisan test --filter=PasswordResetTest
```

### Test Coverage
The test suite covers:
- Email password reset flow
- WhatsApp password reset flow
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Security measures
- Session management
- Token cleanup

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files
All password reset activities are logged in:
- `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Key Log Events
- Password reset email sent
- Password reset WhatsApp sent
- Password reset successful
- API errors and retries
- Security violations

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- Email reset: < 2 seconds
- WhatsApp reset: < 5 seconds (including API calls)
- Database queries: < 100ms
- Page load times: < 1 second

### Caching Strategy
- User lookups: 5 minutes cache
- Session data: 30 minutes timeout
- API responses: No caching (real-time)

## Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Send reset code: 5 attempts per minute
- Verify code: 10 attempts per minute
- Reset password: 3 attempts per minute

### Session Security
- 30-minute session timeout
- User ID validation
- IP address logging
- User agent logging

### Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation

   - Check API response logs

2. **Session expired**
   - Check session configuration
   - Verify database connection
   - Check session table exists

3. **Rate limiting**
   - Wait for rate limit to reset
   - Check IP address
   - Verify user is not blocked

4. **Database errors**
